# 🏗️ Multi-Tenant Feature-Toggled API Server

This is a Node.js and Express-based REST API server that supports **multi-tenancy** and **feature toggling**. Each tenant can have different access to features such as analytics, user management, and notifications. It is structured with modular controllers and models, and uses middleware to enforce tenant-based restrictions.
